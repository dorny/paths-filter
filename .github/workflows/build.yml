# cancel in-progress jobs if a new job is triggered
# This is useful to avoid running multiple builds for the same branch if a new commit is pushed
# or a pull request is updated.
# It helps to save resources and time by ensuring that only the latest commit is built and tested
# This is particularly useful for long-running jobs that may take a while to complete.
# The `group` is set to a combination of the workflow name, event name, and branch name.
# This ensures that jobs are grouped by the workflow and branch, allowing for cancellation of
# in-progress jobs when a new commit is pushed to the same branch or a new pull request is opened.
