      Git reference (e.g. branch name) against which the changes will be detected. Defaults to repository default branch (e.g. master).
      If it references same branch it was pushed to, changes are detected against the most recent commit before the push.
      This option is ignored if action is triggered by pull_request event.

      Enables listing of files matching the filter:
        'none'  - Disables listing of matching files (default).
        'json'  - Matching files paths are serialized as JSON array.
        'shell' - Matching files paths are escaped and space-delimited. Output is usable as command line argument list in linux shell.

      How many commits are initially fetched from base branch.
      If needed, each subsequent fetch doubles the previously requested number of commits
      until the merge-base is found or there are no more commits in the history.
      This option takes effect only when changes are detected using git against different base branch.
